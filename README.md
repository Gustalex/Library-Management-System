### College Project : Library Management System 

This Project is a part of my college project. The main aim of this project is to create a library management system. The system will be able to manage books, customers, reservations and the borrowing process. 

#### Technologies Used

- **Python and Django**:
  - Django: I used Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create the API that will be used to manage the library system.

- **JavaScript**:
  - Axios: Used to make HTTP requests from the client side to the API.

#### Project Finality

The project refers to the development of a bookstore management system, as part of the evaluation process for the Software Project course taught by Professor Dr. Baldo√≠no Fonseca dos Santos Neto at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). The main objective of the project is to create a system that allows the management of books, customers, reservations and the borrowing process while put into practice the concepts learned during the course.

#### How it works

1. **Implementation of the API in Django**:
   - Creation of an API using Django Rest Framework.

2. **Implementation of the client side with JavaScript, HTML and CSS**:
   - The scripts are responsible for making requests to the API to manage the library system.
   - The client side is a simple HTML page with JavaScript scripts.
   - Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Certify yourself to have the following installed on your local environment:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) 

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

Clone the `libsys` project repository to your local machine:
    

### Step 2: Configure the Django Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    Create a new Python virtual environment in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   Install all required dependencies using pip, they are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File**
    Create a new `.env` file in the `libsys` directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@provider.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Project

1. **Run the Django Server**

   If it is the first time you are running the project, you will need to create the database and run the migrations:
   ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

   Run the Django development server using the `manage.py` script:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```


3. **Access the Web Aplication**
   Access the web application opening any HTML file in the `webApp\public\views` directory with live server.
